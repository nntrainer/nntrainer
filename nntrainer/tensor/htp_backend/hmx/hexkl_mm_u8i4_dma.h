 * Turns hexkl_mm_u8i4's accuracy-harness building blocks (plan / bake /
 * run, one matmul at a time, weight baked fresh every call) into the
 * performance path item 3 describes: a weight is baked once
 * and kept DSP-resident until released, and a "layer" of matmuls that share
 * one activation (Q/K/V, or gate/up) runs back to back with the next
 * weight prefetched into VTCM while the current one computes the
 * cross-matmul win measured in (1.7-2x over SDKL on V79). */
